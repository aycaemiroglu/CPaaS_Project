# CPaaS_Project

A two person internship project for deploying secure, repeatable configurations for servers using vagrant, packer and ansible.

Features:
* Multiple server setup with one of them being public and working as a reverse proxy server and the others being placeholders for different types of web app servers.
* Secure SSH setup that can be easily adapted for multiple users.
* Highly repeatable and consistent.
